# Financial-Website-Remake

I had access to real Figma design files for an actual client that needed a redesign of his website. After stripping away all the logos and photos, I built the site! This is the most in-depth site I've made, and I tried to include everything to some degree, focusing quite a bit on small improvements for myself with responsiveness and modal windows (JS finally!).
